# FARS

“FingerAbdruckRecognitionSystem“ is a C++ visualization using Dear ImGui to test and compare fingerprint extraction and matching libraries and algorithms. 

The tool is based on modules that can be directly integrated, or standalone executables that are called using command line arguments. Data is shared using fingerprint template standards and it supports a wide variety of image formats thanks to opencv2. Results can be visualized using the SourceAfis-java-Tool which is not yet integrated in the visualization and needs to be called separately. 

The source code of the FARS modules can be found on https://github.com/DerSpeedMann/FarsModules
